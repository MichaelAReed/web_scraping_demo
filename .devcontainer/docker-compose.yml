# In general, we are using docker compose to allow us to run Selenium for testing. This
# requires a container with the target browser setup installed.
# Selenium provides containers for each browser as well as a hub to route requests to
# the appropriate browser container.
# This file is based on the devcontainer docker compose tutorial/example and an example
# provided on medium for dynamodb and FastAPI but not in a devcontainer.
